Free, private image and PDF compression in your browser.

**Try it live at [shrinkme.app](https://shrinkme.app/)**

Shrink Me compresses JPG, PNG, WEBP, SVG and PDF files. All compression runs on your device: the files never leave your browser, and nothing is uploaded to a server.

## Features

- **Private by design**: all compression runs in the browser, so your files stay on your device.
- **Images**: compresses JPG, PNG and WEBP (60% quality for JPG and WEBP) and optimizes SVG.
- **PDFs**: compresses PDFs with Ghostscript compiled to WebAssembly, running in a Web Worker.
- **Batch processing**: compresses any number of files at once and downloads them as a single ZIP.
- **Works offline**: an installable Progressive Web App (PWA) with a service worker.
- **Multilingual**: available in English, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, French, Bengali, Portuguese and German, picked from the browser languages or in the footer.
- **Live counter**: a global count of compressed files and saved bytes, updated live over WebSockets.

## How It Works

| Format          | Library                                                                                          | Runs in     |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- |
| JPG, PNG, WEBP  | [Compressor.js](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs)                                    | Main thread |
| SVG             | [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)                                                              | Main thread |
| PDF             | [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) via [`@okathira/ghostpdl-wasm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okathira/ghostpdl-wasm) | Web Worker  |

The app is a static [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) single-page app built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), with state in [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/). It is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

The only server-side part is the live counter. It is a [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) with a [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) ([`workers/counter`](workers/counter)) that pushes totals to visitors over hibernatable WebSockets. It only receives numbers (files compressed and bytes saved), never files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 LTS (the exact version is in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc))
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), provided by [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) at the version pinned in `package.json`

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Safi1012/shrinkme.app.git
cd shrinkme.app
corepack enable
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # placeholder details for the legal pages
pnpm dev
```

Then open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

`pnpm dev` starts both the Vite dev server and the counter Worker (on `localhost:8787`, proxied under `/api`). The app also works without the Worker; only the live counter stays empty.

## Scripts

| Command                | Action                                                          |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts the app at `localhost:5173` and the live counter Worker  |
| `pnpm build`           | Type-checks and builds for production into `dist/`              |
| `pnpm test:unit --run` | Runs the unit tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)          |
| `pnpm test:e2e`        | Runs the end-to-end tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) |
| `pnpm lint`            | Lints and fixes with [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter) |
| `pnpm format`          | Formats with [Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter) |

All scripts are in [`package.json`](package.json).

Unit tests (`*.spec.ts`) sit next to the code they cover.

## Testing

```sh
pnpm test:unit --run                      # unit tests, single run
pnpm exec playwright install chromium webkit  # once, to download the browsers
pnpm test:e2e                             # e2e tests in Chromium and WebKit
pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium          # a single browser
```

Locally, the e2e tests start (or reuse) the dev server. CI runs them against the production build.

## Deployment

On every push to `main`, the [CI pipeline](.github/workflows/pipeline.yml) checks formatting, lints, runs the unit tests, builds the app, and runs the e2e tests in Chromium and WebKit. It then deploys the site to Cloudflare Pages and the counter Worker to Cloudflare. Pull requests are checked the same way but not deployed.

## Versioning and Releases

Shrink Me follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) and is released with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). Commit messages must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), because they decide the next version and end up in the changelog:

| Commit message                                  | Release | Changelog section |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------ | :---------------- |
| `fix: keep the file name of renamed PNGs`       | Patch   | Bug Fixes         |
| `perf: decode images off the main thread`       | Patch   | Performance       |
| `feat: let the JPG quality be chosen`           | Minor   | Features          |
| `feat!: drop support for Safari 15`             | Major   | Breaking Changes  |
| `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `build:`, `style:` | None | Not listed |

On every push to `main`, release-please keeps a release pull request open that bumps `package.json` and adds the new entries to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Merging it tags the release and publishes it on GitHub. The deploy that follows ships the new version, and its changelog appears at [shrinkme.app/changelog](https://shrinkme.app/changelog).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, from bug reports and translations to new features. For anything bigger than a small fix, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Safi1012/shrinkme.app/issues) first.

Open pull requests against `main`, use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), and make sure the checks pass:

```sh
pnpm format:check && pnpm lint:check && pnpm type-check && pnpm test:unit --run
